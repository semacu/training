### Overview

Many funders and publishers now require you to get an Open Researcher and Contributor ID ([**ORCID**](https://orcid.org/)): an identifier that is unique to you and which comes with you wherever you go. It eliminates *ambiguity* about your name so you can get full credit for your work.

Do you have an ORCID id? Are you sure how best to use it? Bring your own device to this practical session and register for an ORCID id, explore its features and find out more.

  - Enhance your online profile :computer:


### Motivation

Main points:

1. **Linking** you and your work uniquely. **Sharing** your research effectively
2. **Resolving** name ambiguity with identifiers
3. **Making** identifiers lasting forever

Details:

- You’ve done the hard work of producing that piece of research: make it easy to find! Need of a simple web resource to **link you with your academic work** effectively and uniquely. This would allow you to **share** and **search** research effectively :mag_right::
  - All your publications, biography, funding, data sets, patents, teaching materials ...
  - How best to find the work of others?

- Names are complex - the same name can refer to different people, and one person may have multiple names. **Name ambiguity** impedes unique identification of researchers :dancers:. This ambivalence is spread across cultures, e.g. James Smith, Zhang Li, María García ... Names have variations, change over time and are often expressed in different ways in different situations or languages.

E.g. the following article has **4** Zhang H., **4** Zhang J., **4** Zhang L. and **5** Zhang Y. coauthors!

</p>

- How to manage your list of works when **moving between institutions**? ... and keeping it updated too? Your email address will soon expire after you leave the university :sweat:

- Avoid the **yet another password** problem when submitting papers, or applying for funding / jobs


### What is an ORCID id?

>ORCID’s vision is a world where all who participate in research, scholarship, and innovation are uniquely identified and connected to their contributions and affiliations across disciplines, borders, and time. We provide an identifier for individuals to use with their name as they share their ideas. We provide open tools that enable transparent connections between researchers, and identifiers for their contributions, and affiliations (https://orcid.org/about/trust/home).

- It is a **16-digit number**, e.g. 0000-0002-1825-0097, used in combination with a https URI, e.g. [https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097)


### Features

- An ORCID id is a number designed to be a **career-long identifier**. No information that can change over your career, e.g., name, country, institution, field of study, is embedded in the actual id.

- Distinguish yourself from other researchers! Even if they have the same name as you during your entire career. ORCID ids are **unique and persistent** specifically for researchers, analysts and scholars - like an ISBNs or DOIs, but for people, e.g. here are three different people named `Sergio Martínez`, each with a different ORCID id:

  - [https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9806-2805](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9806-2805) (me)
  - [https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3941-5348](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3941-5348) (an informatics engineer in Catalunya)
  - [https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7322-5898](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7322-5898) (a physicist in Madrid)

- Unlike email addresses, if you leave your current work place, **the ORCID record travels with you**, along with your list of past activities.

- Your data, **owned and controlled** by you:
  - Users have full control over *what data are linked to their id*, and how those data are made *public, limited or private*. Your ORCID id is always publicly visible, but you control the [visibility settings](https://support.orcid.org/knowledgebase/articles/124518-visibility-settings) for all other content in your record.
  
  - Unlike most online research profile systems, ORCID is a not-for-profit organisation so users *own their id and record* (the data linked to their identifier). Whereas ORCID makes your data available in the public domain under a Creative Commons [CC0 License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license#CC0) through their website, it doesn’t track you or sell your data.
  
  - Trusted organizations may add, update, or remove information in your ORCID record *only if* you have granted permission for them to do so.

- Your record is **not** a repository for your research files, ORCID simply links to wherever they live in a handy page about yourself that you can then share publicly with others, or keep to yourself.

>Andrew Dunning, University of Toronto, Canada:
>
>I use my iD as an online master list of all my publications: it’s the perfect link to give anyone who wants to read what I’ve done recently, introduce me at a conference, or consider me for a new position. Since the source of the information is clearly shown, it’s easier to confirm that I’m not making it up (https://orcid.org/blog/2018/02/15/create-sustainable-research-portfolio-orcid).

E.g. you could use it as:

  - A constantly updated digital CV
  - A way to save time when submitting manuscripts and funding. Many [publishers](https://orcid.org/content/requiring-orcid-publication-workflows-open-letter) and [funding bodies](https://orcid.org/content/funders-orcid-policies) now require an ORCID.
  - A key to create your annual report

>From the editorial office of Nature Structural and Molecular Biology:
>
>Dear Dr. Martinez Cuesta,
>Please note that you are listed as a co-author on the manuscript ...
>In addition, Springer Nature encourages all authors and reviewers to associate an Open Researcher and Contributor Identifier (ORCID) to their account. ORCID is a community-based initiative that provides an open, non-proprietary and transparent registry of unique identifiers to help disambiguate research contributions. 

- First launched in 2012, ORCID ids are beginning to be [widely-used](https://orcid.org/statistics) in different academic contexts:

</p>

- You can **grant permission to one or more trusted individuals** to update your ORCID record (might be relevant to group leaders and personal assistants). See [here](https://support.orcid.org/knowledgebase/articles/217659-trusted-individuals).


### Demonstration

This will be a brief example where I will be using my own ORCID record (https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9806-2805) to illustrate how you can operate with it.


### Register for an account :computer:

4. Sign in with your ORCID details to authorize the University of Cambridge / Symplectic Elements as a trusted organisation to read your ORCID record


### Extend your ORCID record :computer:

:speech_balloon: Work in pairs, introduce yourself to the person sitting next to you and collaborate on completing each of your individual records:

1. Login into your ORCID account

2. Edit some of your personal details (click pencil icons on the left side of the page), e.g.
  - Name
  - Country
  - Emails - Add all the addresses you use in your research to ensure that you don’t accidentally sign up again with one of them or lose access to your account.

3. Add your PhD or your recent qualification to the `Education` section:
  - Hover over `+ Add education` and click on `+ Add manually`. Fill in the boxes and click on `Add to list`.
  - Once added, play with the visibility settings and the `View public version` button (see left of the page) to understand how privacy works in ORCID.
  
4. Add publications to the `Works` section:
  - Hover over `+ Add works` and click on `Search and link`. To import your works from other databases, select one of the following and:
    - **Scopus** to ORCID - enter your full name and select your profile, then review and send publications
    - **CrossRef** Metadata Search - allow CrossRef as a trusted organisation to change your profile, browse through the publications and click on the `ADD TO ORCID` icons.
    - **DataCite** - on the `ORCID Search and Link` section click on `search`, browse through your works and click on the `Add to ORCID record` icons.
    - **Europe PubMed Central** - browse through your publications and select them, then go to the top of the page and click on `Continue`. Review the publications to be added and click on `Send to ORCID`.
    - :speech_balloon: Explore other databases and talk about them with your discussion partner
  - To manually edit your `Works`:
    - Click on the `Make a copy and edit` button under each work and include any missing information or identifiers.
    - Hover over `+ Add works` and click on `+ Add manually` to include any of your works that haven't been found by any of the database searchers above.
